This project was completed by Bryson Paul, Jinan Patel, Maximus Smith, and Brian Mercier.
It was designed and developed as part of the UCF 2023 Morgan & Morgan Hackathon with the intention to assist in one's ability to quickly comprehend legal documents with the assistance of Google's Vision API and OpenAI's GPT-4 API.
The purpose behind this project was to cut one hour out of a case management process.
We were told to work with the mindset that anything is possible, and we have a magic wand. 
Given the complex world of case managament, we were tasekd with answering the question:
"What do you cut?"
